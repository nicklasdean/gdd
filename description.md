# Globally Distributed Development

This elective is offered & developed as a collaboration with CrossWorkers (https://crossworkers.dk/) & Ain Shams University faculty of engineering (https://eng.asu.edu.eg/).

The course requires students to engage in transnational groups – meaning that you will work in a setup with 50% danish students & 50% students from Kairo, Egypt.

You will collaborate in building a full-stack application with requirements from the industry - CrossWorkers. This course requires close collaboration and will be significantly more time consuming than the average elective. It will furthermore require travel to Kairo (1 week) and the ability to speak, write and understand English.

This elective is directed at students willing to invest time, travel and commitment.

 

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION**

\-    Since we are travelling to as part of the process you are expected to be fully COVID-19 vaccinated at the start of the course.

\-    Unfortunately we cannot offer this course for all applicants. 

We are conducting interviews with applicants to ensure a healthy composition of students. Former grades do have some significance but are not the final determining factor. 

Anyone willing to commit time & effort are encouraged to apply. 

 

## Learning objectives 

·   General experience with globally distributed software development

·   Skills to divide an IT-system appropriately so that groups can work relatively independently of each other (low coupling between groups)

·   Skills to divide an IT-system so that parts of the IT system require specific skills (high cohesion in the work done by each group)

·   Skills to establish clear contracts between parts of an IT-system (coded contracts) and the groups (division of work contracts) working on the realization of these parts

·   Skills to quality-insure own and other deliveries (parts/sub-systems) to an IT-system

·   Skills to manage cooperation between software development groups

·   Understanding that the choice between disciplined and agile methods may/will be influenced by distance in culture (including educational background), time and space
